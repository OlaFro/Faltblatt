          Hi there! My name is Ola, born in Poland, now living in Leipzig,
          Germany. I studied photography and worked as a photographer for a
          couple of years. After that I came to Germany for my master studies
          (journalism and public relation) and after my graduation I’ve decided
          to stay. <br />
          <br />
          Because of that I was changing apartments a lot during last years.
          Constantly moving out and in every couple of months had forced me to
          limit the amount of my belongings, furniture and interior accessories
          also. But after my partner and I finally moved to our long-term flat,
          I just couldn’t wait to arrange it in our own, special way! I started
          looking for the lampshades to buy, but all I found just wasn’t right.
          So I decided to make them on my own, started googling the techniques
          and… this is how (accidentally) Faltblatt was born!<br />
          <br />
          Interior design is and has always been my great passion and I had even
          thought about studying it, but eventually it turned out the other way.
          I don’t regret it though. During the years working as a photographer I
          developed great sensibility to light and the atmosphere it gives. I
          consider my work at Faltblatt as a continuation, next step or level on
          this path. My aim is to design light, aesthetic, minimalistic objects
          that give warm, peaceful and cozy feeling. I use for the lampshades
          exclusively white paper and use color only for the decoration products
          (i mean light strings). I want the light and the form to play the main
          role and don’t want to distract them by too many factors. <br /><br />
          Less is more!

            The Ultimate Experience with Faltblatt <br />
            After moving to a new flat in Berlin, we faced a big dilemma: how to
            arrange a typical high sealing space in our big kitchen. When we
            came across Faltblatt, we had no doubt it is not only the design we
            liked, but also an opportunity to bring to our new home an ultimate
            experience, which can animate a social hot spot – our kitchen. The
            execution surprised us as well. Attention to details. Perfect!

            Absolutely gorgeous! I've been looking for something like this for
            months. It's perfect to hang on my coloured-flex wall pendant. The
            shade comes with a little ring to attach to the fitting then you
            just draw the string. It was so simple and looks beautiful. Thank
            you!

            Extremely fast and sincere customer service. Phenomenally beautiful
            and handcrafted origami. Would have been even better if the lights
            were a just a little bit warmer in tone.
